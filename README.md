# Hangman Game

## Overview

Welcome to Hangman, a classic word-guessing game! This Python script allows you to play Hangman, where you try to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting letters. Be careful, though, as you have a limited number of lives!

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hangman.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Hangman
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python hangman.py
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to guess letters and try to figure out the hidden word.

5. The game will provide feedback on your guesses and display the current state of the word.

6. If you guess all the letters correctly before running out of lives, you win! Otherwise, the game will reveal the correct word.

## Features
